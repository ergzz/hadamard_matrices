# hadamard_matrices
EML project on hadamard matrices (in French)

This is an Experimental Mathematics project realized for the Summer semester 2021 at the University of Luxembourg. 

The goal is to understand properties of Hadamard matrices, how to construct them and how to use the to correct errors in a message. 

Here, there is : 
- a Python program sylvester.py for the Sylvester construction (+ how to generate an image with matplotlib to represent that matrix)
- a Python program paley.py for the Paley construction (in F_p, not in F_q with q=p^k)
- a Python program correction.py that can correct messages sent in an ASCII format
